Marco understands the slippery politics of Mexican law enforcement, and while his police force slowly succumbs to the pressures and demands of the cartel, he's one of the last good men in the department. He's charming, but will do whatever it takes to get what he needs -- which doesn't sit well with Sonya, who has Asperger's and strictly follows rules and protocol.The case quickly pulls them into a string of murders on the border, a scene already consumed by illegal immigration, drug trafficking, violence and prostitution.",

The show starred Don Johnson and Cheech Marin as two detectives with the San Francisco Police Department. Nash Bridges (Johnson) is Captain of the Special Investigations Unit (with offices aboard a siezed boat), a man-about-town, who drives around in a distinctive yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda ('The Cuda'). He has two ex-wives, many girlfriends and a young daughter (who eventually joins the police force) to keep him busy.  Joe Dominguez (Marin), Nash's partner and best friend is a affable Mexican-American, firmly under the thumb of his Swedish wife Inger, and always on the look out for ways to make money on the side.
